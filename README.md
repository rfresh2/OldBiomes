# OldBiomes
Standalone 1.12.2 Biome Generator for [XaeroPlus](https://github.com/rfresh2/XaeroPlus) OldBiomes feature

This is a stripped down fork of https://github.com/KaptainWutax/BiomeUtils (and its associated dependencies)

Forked to reduce jar size by removing features I don't need. And to publish to my personal maven: `https://maven.2b2t.vc`
